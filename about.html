		<h1><span>mustacchio started</span></h1>
	<p>There once was a man whose name is too weird and a razor blade never touched a hair on his beard. Well his beard got so long that eventually…

		It wrapped seven times around every green tree
		
		It sprawled off of cliffs and danced in the breeze
		
		It covered tall mountains and clogged all the streams
		
		It even crossed oceans and all seven seas
		
		It travelled through islands and wrapped around volcanos
		
		It flew up into the clouds and drooped across rainbows
		
		It slithered through swamps and dark, gloomy bogs
		
		It crept over mushrooms and underneath frogs
		
		It zigzagged through cities and stretched across streets
		
		And in the country some used it to hang their sheets!
		
		You may be wondering “Where does the beard end?” It goes all the way back to where it began
		
		One day the old man was thinking a lot and decided to cut his entire beard off!
		
		He turned all the hair from his beard into wigs and donated them all to hair-needing pigs</p>

		<p>I’ve had my beard for on & off now about 6 years, in its uncut format! For a constant 3 years now, just a general trim, which I do myself I’ve attempted visiting barbershops…but if there’s gonna be a problem it’s going to be my fault hahah, the guy who cuts my hair Sean, will give it a bit of a snip but no more.<br> My Beard over time has genuinely come to define me, I have workmates who have never seen me without it, Family & Friends identify me by it… at times it has a life of its own.

			I have been stopped on multiple occasions while walking through town for pictures, interviews I was also featured in a local style magazine, but there hangs another tail, the look is also important just tee & jeans won’t cut it.</p>
