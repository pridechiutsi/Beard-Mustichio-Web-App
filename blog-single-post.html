				<h2>WHY I GREW A MUSTACHE</h2>
			</div>
			<p>I have a beard.*These are my stories about my experience with my beard – people’s reactions, my reactions to their reactions, and what I’ve learned about myself, gender, identity, race, class, assumptions, and people through these interactions.

				Eventually, I hope to compile these stories into a book.
				
				*I’m a female-bodied person who was tagged female at birth. I mostly identify as female in my daily life, but I also identify as gender-fluid/-queer/-variant/-unaffiliated. In various settings in my life I’m sometimes male-identified.
				
				**My beard grows on its own, without the assistance of creams, pills, or added hormones. It is dense and curly – it’s more than a few stray hairs, and it’s obvious and visible even from a distance or in blurry pictures. It started growing when I was about 13, and I shaved and tweezed for years to keep it hidden. In May 2008, I started letting it grow. I’ve been bearded more or less continuously since then.

				<h2>How long have you had your beard?</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					I’ve had my beard for on & off now about 6 years, in its uncut format! For a constant 3 years now, just a general trim, which I do myself I’ve attempted visiting barbershops…but if there’s gonna be a problem it’s going to be my fault hahah, the guy who cuts my hair Sean, will give it a bit of a snip but no more.</p>

					<h2>What tools do you use to groom your beard?</h2>
					</div>
					<p>
						I have numerous combs & brushes, but will always go back to my Captain Fawcett Wild Boar bristle brush & Ox Horn comb, I prefer natural products as each will help develop the Beard & the accessory used.</p>

						<h2>How do you maintain your beard?</h2>
						</div>
						<p>
							I still use a cut throat razor to trim my Cheek & Neck lines…always gives a cleaner edge, also there’s that element of danger, I have recently invested in a straightener…excellent find, I have multiple oils & balms again Capt Fawcett is always my go too.</p>

							<h2>How do you feel about your beard?</h2>

							<p>
								My Beard over time has genuinely come to define me, I have workmates who have never seen me without it, Family & Friends identify me by it… at times it has a life of its own.
								
								I have been stopped on multiple occasions while walking through town for pictures, interviews I was also featured in a local style magazine, but there hangs another tail, the look is also important just tee & jeans won’t cut it.</p>
